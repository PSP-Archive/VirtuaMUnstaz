Demo Release 1.0
  for the VirtuaMUnstaz VMU Emulator for the PSP

This is a simple port of the VMU Emulator by Marcus Comstedt
(see http://mc.pp.se/dc/) to the PSP using SDL. It currently
runs demos and most of the small games written for the VMU.

Watch the small demo and if you are sick of the scroller
copy TETRIS.VMS to SCROLL.VMS and restart the demo. Have fun.

Watch http://virtuamunstaz.de/ for updates and source releases.

Thanks to PSP-News, WAB and everyone who made this possible.
